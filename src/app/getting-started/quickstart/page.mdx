# Quickstart

In this Quickstart guide, you'll learn the typical workflow with Teo from
creating an empty project, setting up a connection with a local database to
sending HTTP requests with the generated query client.

## Choose your stack

Before getting started, pick and select your own technical stack. And this
guide will just be tailored for you. Also, your preferences are saved locally.
The next time you open any documentation in our site, your tech stack
preferences are preserved and restored for you.

## Prerequisites

<RustDoc>
You need Rust 1.67.0 or higher for this guide. If you don't have Rust
installed, see this
[installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from Rust.
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
You need Node.js 18.4.0 or higher for this guide. If you don't have Node.js
installed, download it from [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
You need Python 3.11.1 or higher for this guide. If you don't have Python
installed, download it from
[official download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
</PythonDoc>

## 1. Create a new project and set up Teo

<RustDoc>
As a first step, create a project with `cargo` and navigate into it:

```sh
cargo new hello-teo --bin
cd hello-teo
```

Next, install Teo command line tool with this command:

```sh
cargo install teo
```

This installs Teo CLI into the cargo global path.

{/* Next open `Cargo.toml` and append these two lines under `[dependencies]`
section.

```toml showLineNumbers title="Cargo.toml"
teo = { version = "0.0.47" }
tokio = { version = "1.25.0", features = ["macros"] }
```

If your IDE or editor doesn't automatically install the dependencies for you,
run manual installation with this command:

```sh
cargo install --path .
``` */}
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
As a first step, create a blank directory and setup a new Node.js project in
it:

```sh
mkdir hello-teo
cd hello-teo
npm init
```

`npm init` prompts you for many inputs, just press `enter` all the way.

Next, install the `@teocloud/teo` package with this command:

```sh
npm install @teocloud/teo
```

## 2. Connect to database and set up server

Create a file at project root directory named `schema.teo` with the following
content:

<MySQLDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
connector {
  provider: .mysql,
  url: "mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/helloteo"
}
```
</MySQLDoc>
<PostgreSQLDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
connector {
  provider: .postgres,
  url: "postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/helloteo"
}
```
</PostgreSQLDoc>
<SQLiteDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
connector {
  provider: .sqlite,
  url: "sqlite:helloteo.sqlite"
}
```
</SQLiteDoc>
<MongoDBDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
connector {
  provider: .mongo,
  url: "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/helloteo"
}
```
</MongoDBDoc>

Within this `connector` config block, we specified which database to use. Next,
let's declare a `server` block to specify on which port this HTTP server should
be listening.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
server {
  bind: ("0.0.0.0", 5050)
}
```

Our server will be listening on port 5050 after started.

## 3. Model your data in the schema

Now time for modeling data. Let's dive right in to declare some models.

<SQLDatabaseDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @unique @onSet($if($presents, $isEmail))
  email: String
  name: String?
  @relation(fields: .id, references: .authorId)
  posts: Post[]
}

model Post {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  title: String
  content: String?
  @default(false)
  published: Bool
  @foreignKey
  authorId: Int
  @relation(fields: .authorId, references: .id)
  author: User
}
```
</SQLDatabaseDoc>
<MongoDBDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
model User {
  @id @auto @map("_id") @readonly
  id: ObjectId
  @unique @onSet($if($presents, $isEmail))
  email: String
  name: String?
  @relation(fields: .id, references: .userId)
  posts: Post[]
}

model Post {
  @id @auto @map("_id") @readonly
  id: ObjectId
  title: String
  content: String?
  @default(false)
  published: Bool
  @foreignKey
  authorId: ObjectId
  @relation(fields: .authorId, references: .id)
  author: User
}
```
</MongoDBDoc>

Models in the Teo schema have two main purposes:

- Represent the tables or collections in the underlying database
- Represent a group of API resource including handler actions like `findMany`,
`findUnique`, `create`, etc.

## 4. Generate query client

If you start the server with `cargo teo serve`, you can already see server
started and listening on the desired port. Instead of writing each HTTP
request on the frontend, Teo can generate a client for you with great auto
completion.

Add this block into `schema.teo`:

<TypeScriptDoc>
```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
client ts {
  provider: .typeScript,
  dest: "../hello-teo-client/",
  package: true,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:5050",
  gitCommit: true
}
```
</TypeScriptDoc>
<SwiftDoc>
Swift is not currently supported.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
client swift {
  provider: .swift,
  dest: "../hello-teo-client/",
  package: true,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:5050",
  gitCommit: true
}
```
</SwiftDoc>
<KotlinDoc>
Kotlin is not currently supported.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
client kotlin {
  provider: .kotlin,
  dest: "../hello-teo-client/",
  package: true,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:5050",
  gitCommit: true
}
```
</KotlinDoc>
<CSharpDoc>
C# is not currently supported.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
client cs {
  provider: .cSharp,
  dest: "../hello-teo-client/",
  package: true,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:5050",
  gitCommit: true
}
```
</CSharpDoc>
<DartDoc>
Dart is not currently supported.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
client dart {
  provider: .dart,
  dest: "../hello-teo-client/",
  package: true,
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:5050",
  gitCommit: true
}
```
</DartDoc>

Now let's run this command to generate a brand new client.

<RustDoc>
```sh
cargo teo generate client
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```sh
npx teo generate client
```
</NodeJSDoc>

## 5. Send HTTP requests with query client

Start a development server with this command:
<RustDoc>
```sh
cargo teo serve
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```sh
npx teo serve
```
</NodeJSDoc>

Now navigate to the generated client and write some code to perform HTTP
requests.

```sh
cd ../hello-teo-client
```

<TypeScriptDoc>
Create a file named `hello.ts` in the root directory of the generated client
with the following content:

```ts showLineNumbers
import { teo } from './src/index.js'

async function main() {
  const results = await teo.user.create({
    create: {
      email: "ada@teocloud.io",
      name: "Ada",
      posts: {
        create: [
          {
            title: "Framework TEO",
            content: "This post introduces Teo."
          },
          {
            title: "The next generation",
            content: "Use the next generation technology."
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    include: {
      posts: true
    }
  })
  console.log(results.data)
}

main()
```

Install `ts-node` and run this file.

<CodeResult name="result" defaultOpen={true}>
```sh
npm install -D ts-node
node --loader ts-node/esm hello.ts
```
```json showLineNumbers
{
  id: 1,
  email: 'ada@teocloud.io',
  name: 'Ada',
  posts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Framework TEO',
      content: 'This post introduces Teo.',
      published: false,
      authorId: 1
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'The next generation',
      content: 'Use the next generation technology.',
      published: false,
      authorId: 1
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeResult>

We've just created an object with nested relations. See how easy it is. We lift
Teo to do a lot of heavy work for us.

</TypeScriptDoc>

## 6. Next steps

In this Quickstart guide, you have a brief overview and understand how Teo works.
To learn further, read our [Beginner tutorial](#).
Feel free to explore the server & clients API a bit more on your own, e.g. by
including filtering, sorting, and pagination options in the `findMany`
requests or exploring more operations like update and delete objects.

### Join the Teo community 💚

Teo is great and needs your support. Join us on Slack or ask questions via
GitHub Discussions.

{/* - We've defined two models: `User` and `Post`. Each represents:
  1. A database table or collection
  2. A set of API resource
- We've specified field definitions with the model block.
  1. The data type of the field
  2. Whether this field is required or optional
  3. An optional default value
  3. Is this field unique or indexed?
  4. Any validators or transformers to run when setting values or on save
  5. Other information like `column_name` or `description`
- We've written relationships to hook these two models together.
  1. A user has many posts.
  2. A post belongs to a user. */}

{/* The traditional HTTP server frameworks let you write your model definitions and
your controllers routes separately. You need to double the workload at
least. Working with Teo, we are different. We use functional declarative
syntax. And we declare everything just once.

Congratulations, you now have your model definitions ready. On server start,
database migration is automatically performed. So just don't need to worry
about it. Let's go and learn how you can send some HTTP requests to read and
write data on server. */}

{/*
<PrevNext>
  <PrevArticle href="a">Model definition</PrevArticle>
  <NextArticle href="a">Model definition</NextArticle>
</PrevNext> */}

{/*
The HTTP request URL has a convention of `/{resource}/action/{action}`. Let's
say, to update a user, it's `/users/action/update`. To display a dashboard of
user aggregated data, it's `/users/action/group-by`. The request body is a JSON
contains data inputs or filters.

To create a user, let's type this curl command into the command line.

```sh
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:5100/users/action/create -d
'{"create": {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}}'
```

To list all users, we post onto `find-many` action.

```sh
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:5100/users/action/find-many -d '{}'
```

If you use auto generated client, you don't need to handle these requests by
yourself. Instead, the classes and interfaces are just well declared for you.
Feel free to end this tutorial if you don't need generated clients. */}
