# Write a schema only app

Let's start with the simplest use case: Install Teo and start a schema only app.
By the end of this tutorial, you gain understanding of how Teo schema composites
and how to write them.

## Installation

Install Rust if it hasn't been installed. This bash command is copied from its 
[official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This is the easiest 
and recommended way to install Rust.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

When rust is installed, the package manager `cargo` is in the execution path. 
Install Teo command line tool with it into the global space. 

```sh
cargo install teo
```

Wait for a while and have a rest, cargo is compiling and building Teo. Run 
this command to verify its installation:

<CodeResult name="output" defaultOpen={true}>
```sh
cargo teo --version
```
```txt
teo Teo 0.1.0 (Rust 1.75.0) [CLI]
```
</CodeResult>

If you see the output which prints the version number, nice job, Teo is 
successfully installed. If Teo isn't installed successfully and you cannot
figure it out, leave us an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/teocloud/teo/issues).
We'll investigate and handle it for you.

## Editor plugin

We highly recommand you to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as we created 
a plugin for syntax highlight, code diagnostics, auto completion and jump to definition.
Download our plugin from [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yeannylam.teo-vscode).

## Write your first schema

Create an empty directory and create a file named `schema.teo`.

```sh
mkdir hello-teo
cd hello-teo
touch schema.teo
```

Paste these content into the file.

```teo showLineNumbers
connector {
  provider: .sqlite,
  url: "sqlite::memory:"
}

server {
  bind: ("0.0.0.0", 5050)
}

model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @unique @onSet($if($presents, $isEmail))
  email: String
  name: String?
  @relation(fields: .id, references: .authorId)
  posts: Post[]
}
 
model Post {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  title: String
  content: String?
  @default(false)
  published: Bool
  @foreignKey
  authorId: Int
  @relation(fields: .authorId, references: .id)
  author: User
}
```

Let's explain what this schema describes.

* The `connector` block defines to which database this server connects. The
content of the block is just a plain object literal with some predefined key
value pairs. The expression starts with a `.` is enum variant literal in Teo
schema. It's inspired by Apple's Swift programming language and is widely used
in schema. The benefits of prefixing with a dot is that it's easy to write and 
complete. Obviously, this server app connects to an in-memory SQLite database.

* The `server` block defines how the server behaves. The syntax is the same with
`connector`. These blocks are for configuration, and they are called config blocks
in Teo. Guess what it does? The answer is that the server will listen at port 
`5050`. The thing wrapped by a pair of parenthesis is tuple type. Teo supports a
bunch of builtin types including ranges and tuples. Anyway, there are mostly used
in config blocks. 

* The `model` keyword defines models. A model represents a database table and a
set of auto synthesized HTTP requests to interact with it. The things start with a 
`@` is called decorator. In Teo schema, plenty of things can be decorated including 
models, model fields, model relations. A decorator modifies the behavior of the 
decorated item. The thing start with a `$` is called pipeline. There are one or more
pipeline items in a pipeline. A pipeline validates and transforms its input value
into its output value, or throw errors if value is invalid. Look at this part:
`$if($presents, $isEmail)`. It means when an email value is set, if the value is not
null, which is presented, validate the value against `$isEmail`. If the value passed
in is not a valid email address, revoke this value and throw an error to the 
frontend requester. The `@relation` decorator defines a model relation. In this case,
a user has many posts and a post has an author. The `fields` argument and `references`
argument takes 1 or more primitive fields on the model. These argument describes by
which fields the models are connected. The trailing `?` in a type expression indicates
the value is optional.

In Teo schema, trailing comma is allowed wherever comma is used. The whole schema 
langauge is inspired by a lot of languages like TypeScript, Swift, GraphQL and Prisma.
When we design this, we want developers to feel familiar. We take advantages from 
different programming languages, combine them with our descriptive declarations.
Teo schema is quite easy and not something to learn with. If you have trouble with
understanding Teo schema, take it easy, join our [Discord group](/discord), there 
are people available to help you.

## Add models with many-to-many relations

Append these code to the schema file.

```teo showLineNumbers
model Artist {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  name: String
  @relation(through: Perform, local: .artist, foreign: .song)
  songs: Song[]
}

model Song {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  name: String
  @relation(through: Perform, local: .song, foreign: .artist)
  artists: Artist[]
}

@id([.songId, .artistId])
model Perform {
  @foreignKey
  artistId: Int
  @foreignKey
  songId: Int
  @relation(fields: .songId, references: .id)
  song: Song
  @relation(fields: .artistId, references: .id)
  artist: Artist
}
```

In Teo, unlike Ruby on Rails or Prisma, join table of a many-to-many relation 
is declared explicitly. In a many-to-many relation, `@relation` takes a join
model and two direct relations defined on join model. It's quite clear to 
write everything out in such a short lines of code. Join tables sometimes is
meaningful on their own. With it explicitly declared, database migration won't
be hard when you are adding fields and contents to it. Notice the id of the 
model `Perform` is declared at the level of model. This is a compound primary 
key.

## Run the server

Now run this command to start the server.

<CodeResult name="output" defaultOpen={true}>
```sh
cargo teo serve
```
```txt
[2023-12-20 04:58:40] mysql connector connected for `main` at "mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/helloteo"
[2023-12-20 04:58:40] Teo 0.0.63 (Rust 1.75.0, CLI)
[2023-12-20 04:58:40] listening on port 5050
```
</CodeResult>

If you see the output likt above, congratulation, it starts successfully.
If it cannot start successfully, most of the times, the reason is the 
database setup and configuration.

Now our server is ready to listen and handle requests.

## Create request

Send this request body to `/User/create`.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```json
{
  "create": {
    "email": "ada@teocloud.io",
    "name": "Ada",
    "posts": {
      "create": [
        {
          "title": "Introducing Teo",
          "content": "This post introduces Teo."
        },
        {
          "title": "The next generation framework",
          "content": "Use the next generation technology."
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "include": {
    "posts": true
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "ada@teocloud.io",
    "name": "Ada",
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Introducing Teo",
        "content": "This post introduces Teo.",
        "published": false,
        "authorId": 1
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "The next generation framework",
        "content": "Use the next generation technology.",
        "published": false,
        "authorId": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

In this request, we've created a user with two related posts. If you request this again,
you will get a unique constraint violation error. This is the designated behavior as 
we've declared `email` field of user to be `@unique`.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```text
send again...
```
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ValueError",
    "message": "value is invalid",
    "fields": {
      "create": "unique value duplicated: email"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

Send this request to `/Artist/createMany`.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```json
{
  "create": [
    {
      "name": "Ed Sheeran",
      "songs": {
        "create": [
          {
            "name": "Perfect"
          },
          {
            "name": "Eyes Closed"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Taylor Swift",
      "songs": {
        "create": [
          {
            "name": "Love Story"
          },
          {
            "name": "Red"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "include": {
    "songs": true
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Ed Sheeran",
      "songs": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Perfect"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Eyes Closed"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Taylor Swift",
      "songs": [
        {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Love Story"
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Red"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 2
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

We created two artists with two songs each. In this request, instead of using `create`
handler, we use `createMany`. With `createMany`, the arguments become an array of inputs.
We can create many database records in a single batch. If any record creation failed, 
the transaction mechanism is triggered.

## Find many request

Let's query what we've created before. Send this request body to `/Song/findMany`.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```json
{
  "include": {
    "artists": {
      "select": {
        "name": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```json  
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Perfect",
      "artists": [
        {
          "name": "Ed Sheeran"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Eyes Closed",
      "artists": [
        {
          "name": "Ed Sheeran"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Love Story",
      "artists": [
        {
          "name": "Taylor Swift"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Red",
      "artists": [
        {
          "name": "Taylor Swift"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 4
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

We limited the returned value with `select`. Only selected fields are returned.
We can query further by specify some `where` conditions.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```json
{
  "where": {
    "name": {
      "startsWith": "Perfect"
    }
  },
  "include": {
    "artists": {
      "where": {
        "name": "Not exist"
      },
      "select": {
        "name": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```json     
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Perfect",
      "artists": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 1
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

In this request, only 1 song is returned. Although we include the artists in the 
response, the only artist that is related to the song is filtered out by a where condition.

## Update requests

To perform a update request, combine `where` and `update` together in the 
request body and send it to `/Song/update`.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```json
{
  "where": {
    "id": 1
  },
  "update": {
    "name": "Perfect Symphony",
    "artists": {
      "update": {
        "where": {
          "id": 1
        },
        "update": {
          "name": "Richard Clayderman"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "include": {
    "artists": true
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Perfect Symphony",
    "artists": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Richard Clayderman"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeResult>

We can nested update related records with Teo. If any update is invalid, 
it rollbacks.

## Summary

There are a lot of builtin model route handlers including `delete`, `upsert`, 
`copy`, `createMany`, `findFirst`, `findUnique` and so on. Relation queries
are supported except `delete` and `deleteMany`.

Hope it's not hard to catch up with us. Teo is quite easy and simple to use.
Find us in [our Discord group](/discord) if you have any troubles.

In the next tutorial in this series, you'll learn how to write route handlers
with Teo. Programming code is necessary to write custom business logics.
