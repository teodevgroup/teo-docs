# Config block

Config block is a block level element which contains a schema's config items.

There are several types of config blocks and they look the same way:

```teo showLineNumbers
connector {
  provider: .mysql,
  url: "mysql://localhost:3306/helloteo",
}

server {
  bind: ("0.0.0.0", 5300),
}

client ts {
  provider: .typeScript,
  dest: "../hello-teo",
  host: .string("http://127.0.0.1:5300"),
  package: true,
  gitCommit: true,
}

entity node {
  provider: .node,
  dest: "./src/entities",
}
```

Each config block can optionally have a name. If there are multiple config 
blocks of the same type, a unique name is required.

## Types of config blocks

There are currently 4 types of config blocks in use:

* [Connector](/concepts/components/teo-schema/connector)
* [Server](/concepts/components/teo-schema/server)
* [Generator](/concepts/components/teo-schema/generator)
    * [Model entity generator](/concepts/components/teo-schema/generator#model-entity-generator)
    * [Query client generator](/concepts/components/teo-schema/generator#query-client-generator)

## A note about the future implementation

In the future, more kinds of configs will be added. And package authors may
declare their own config declaration in the packages.
