# Enum

Enum is a Teo schema data type which represents limited amount of 
possibilities. It is declared with the `enum` keyword.

```teo
enum Sex {
  male
  female
}
```

Enum type can be used as model field type. Like any other types, enums can be
used in interfaces, decorator arguments, pipeline arguments and middleware 
arguments.

When using the enum value, instead of typing the full value path, prefix the 
value with a dot is more concise.

```teo
enum Sex {
  male
  female
}

let a = Sex.male // Sex.male
let b: Sex = .female // Sex.female
```

## Interface enum

Interface enum can't be used as a model field type. It can optionally take 
arguments.

```teo
interface enum MySQLDatabaseType {
  varChar(len?: Int)
  text
  char(len?: Int)
  // ...
}
```

## Option enum

This is a seldomly used type. The internal value isn't a string but a positive 
integer. It can perform bitwise operations.

```teo
interface option enum Action {
  create = 1
  update = 1 << 1
  delete = 1 << 2
  copy = 1 << 3
  find = 1 << 4
  first = 1 << 5
}

let a: Action = .create | .update
let b: Action = ~.copy
```
