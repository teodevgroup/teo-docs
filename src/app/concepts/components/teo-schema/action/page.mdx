# Action

An action represents a single action to the underlying database record. It's a
little bit obscure. After the explanation, it's quite easy to understand.

Let's say, to create a new `User`, we trigger the action 
`.create | .single | .entry` on it. If we create two related `Post` records 
when creating a user, we trigger the action `.create | .many | .nested` on the
two post records. Every auto-synthesized 
[handler](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler)
<span className="concept">CONCEPT</span> 
triggers one or more actions.

## The composition of an action

An action has three parts: behavior, single or many, entry level or nested 
level.

See [Action](/reference/api-reference/schema-reference#action)
<span className="concept">REFERENCE</span> for detailed definition.

## Action transformer

> This feature will be added back and this part of documentation will be 
> updated.

Action transformer is used to implement features like soft delete.
