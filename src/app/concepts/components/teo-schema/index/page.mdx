# Index

Indexes are database indexes. With Teo, you can define primary index, normal
index and unique index on both model level and field level.

## Index types

- `primary` this index is used as primary key
- `unique` this index is unique
- `index` a normal index

Both `primary` and `unique` are unique.

## Field index

Field index is defined directly on the field.

```teo showLineNumbers /index/ /unique/ /primary/
model Demo {
  @index
  createdAt: DateTime

  @unique
  email: String?

  @id
  id: Int
}
```

## Compound index

Any field index can be defined on model, too. If an index is compound and it
consists of multiple fields, it can only be defined on model.

```teo showLineNumbers /@id/ /@unique/
@id([.userId, .productId])
@unique([.singer, .year])
model Demo {
  // ...
}
```
