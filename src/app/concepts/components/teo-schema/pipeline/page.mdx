# Pipeline

Pipeline is an innovative and powerful tool invented by us. It provides data 
validation, transformation, and custom callbacks. Developers can attach 
pipelines to both models and to model fields.

## A simple pipeline

Let's see a simple pipeline. This is a model field's `@onSet` pipeline. When a 
new value is set on this field, firstly, it trims leading and trailing 
whitespaces. Then it validates its content against an email regular expression.

```teo showLineNumbers
model Demo {
  @onSet($trim.isEmail)
  email: String
}
```

## Common stages

There are various stages to trigger pipelines, common stages include:

* Model stages
  * `beforeSave` before this object is saved into the database
  * `afterSave` after this object is saved into the database
  * `beforeDelete` before this object is deleted from the database
  * `afterDelete` after this object is deleted from the database
* Model field stages
  * `onSet` when a new value is set
  * `onSave` when this object is being saved into the database
  * `identityChecker` is for identity checker fields only
  * `onOutput` when a value is being outputed into the result JSON

## Pipeline item

A pipeline is composed of one or more pipeline items. Each pipeline item do
exactly one thing. Pipeline items can be piped in any orders as long as the
input of next item matches the output of previous item.

### Kinds of pipeline items

Although a pipeline item can do transform, validation and callback. Normally
there are four main kinds of pipeline items:

* Transform pipeline item transforms value
* Validator pipeline item validates value
* Callback pipeline item performs custom code callback
* Compare pipeline item compares the old and the new value, when the value is
updated, perform callback and return a validating result

### Declare a pipeline item

Use the 'declare' keyword to declare a pipeline item. Argument types, input
type, and output type are required. The argument list can be omitted.

```teo
declare pipeline item identical<T>: T -> T
```

### Implement a pipeline item

Use the server API to implement a pipeline item:

<RustDoc>
```rust showLineNumbers
app.main_namespace().define_pipeline_item("identical", |value: Value| async move {
  Ok(value)
});
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```ts showLineNumbers
app.mainNamespace().definePipelineItem("identical", (value: any) => {
  return value
})
```
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
```python showLineNumbers
def identical(value: Any, args: Any, _object, _teo):
  return value

app.main_namespace().define_pipeline_item("identical", identical)
```
</PythonDoc>
