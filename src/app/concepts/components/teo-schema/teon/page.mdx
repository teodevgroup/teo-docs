# Teon

Teon is Teo extended Json. Teo has data types such as `ObjectId`, `Date`, 
`DateTime`, `Decimal` and other types that Json cannot express. 

The Teon value is quite trivial in Node.js and Python bindings. Just pass a
normal object with the value that Teon supports in Node.js. For Python, a 
normal dict is used. The rust version has nearly the same API with Rust's
famous [`serde_json`](https://github.com/serde-rs/json) library. Most of the 
times, developers don't need to interact with Teon APIs.

## Usage

To declare a Teon object in Node.js, just write a normal object.

```ts showLineNumbers
const myTeonValue = {
    decimal: Decimal("5.20"),
    int: 5,
    float: 5.20
}
```

To declare a Teon object in Python, just write a normal `dict`.

```python showLineNumbers
my_teon_value = {
    "decimal": Decimal("5.20"),
    "int": 5,
    "float": 5.20
}
```

To declare a Teon object in Rust, use the `teon!` macro.

```rust showLineNumbers
let my_teon_value = teon!({
    "decimal": BigDecimal::from_str("5").unwrap(),
    "int": 5,
    "float": 5.20
});
```
