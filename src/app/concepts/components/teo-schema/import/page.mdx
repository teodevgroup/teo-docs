# Import

Teo supports file splitting and loading schema items defined in another file 
into this file.

Load a file with the 'import' keyword. Relative path is used and the extension
can be omitted.

```teo
import "./data" // this loads ./data.teo
```

## The special index file

If a file is named `index.teo`, the file name can be omitted.

```teo
import "./myModule" // this loads ./myModule/index.teo
```

<PrevNext />
