# Generator

Teo has its own schema language. Models and interfaces are described clearly 
with this schema language. To write custom code with Teo, we need to transform
these Teo schema into developer's handy programming language. Teo generator
is a builtin tool to generate programming files.

The generators fall into two main categories:
* Model entities are used for backend programming
* Query clients are for simplifying frontend interaction with Teo server

## Model entity generator

Model entity generator generates model entities and interfaces directly into 
the project in which the schema files live. These entity files provide ORM apis
and interfaces for writing custom backend server app.

Declare a model entity generator in schema is deadly simple.

```teo showLineNumbers
entity {
  provider: .rust,
  dest: "./src/entities"
}
```

In this example, a Rust entity generator is declared. Use the `generate entity`
command to generate the files into the directory defined with `dest` key.

<RustDoc>
```sh
cargo teo generate entity
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```sh
npx teo generate entity
```
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
```sh
teo generate entity
```
</PythonDoc>

Teo model entities behave just like classes and objects in other ORM 
frameworks. Developers can `findMany` objects, `update`, `save` or `delete` an 
object. Transactions are supported with the `teo.transaction` call.

The generated interfaces are for custom handlers. Developers can fetch data 
from HTTP request body with type-safe guards and auto-completion.

## Query client generator

While model entity generator is for backend. The query client generator is for
the frontend. Frontend developers don't need to declare interfaces and DAOs 
anymore. Let Teo do this boring and redundant job.

Declare a query client generator in schema is deadly simple, too.

```teo showLineNumbers
client ts {
  provider:  .typeScript,
  dest:      "../hello-teo-client",
  host:      "http://127.0.0.1:5300",
  package:   true,
  gitCommit: true
}
```

Run `generate client` to have a query client generated. Teo query client is
type-safe and performant.

<RustDoc>
```sh
cargo teo generate client
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```sh
npx teo generate client
```
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
```sh
teo generate client
```
</PythonDoc>

## Admin dashboard generator

The admin dashboard generator generates an admin dashboard for the project. It
reduces a lot of work for hooking things up between the frontend and the 
backend. The admin dashboard is a running frontend, too. It's written with 
React and TypeScript. It utilizes TypeScript query client.

Declare an admin dashboard generator in schema is deadly simple, too.

```teo
admin {
  dest: "../hello-teo-admin-dashboard",
  host: .inject("process.env.TEO_HOST"),
  languages: [.enUs, .enUk, .de, .es, .fr, .he, .hi, .ja, .ko, .zhCn, .zhTw]
}
```

To generate the admin dashboard, use `teo generate admin` command.

<RustDoc>
```sh
cargo teo generate admin
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```sh
npx teo generate admin
```
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
```sh
teo generate admin
```
</PythonDoc>

The admin dashboard looks like this:
