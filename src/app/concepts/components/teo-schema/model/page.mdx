# Model

> This guide introduces the concept of model used in Teo server implementation.
> To understand how to define a model to suit your business requirements, read
> our guide article [Data modeling](/guides/server-guides/data-modeling).
> To get a list of model APIs, check our 
> [API documentation](/reference/api-reference).

A model is mapped into a table or collection in the underlying database, with
each of its fields mapped to a table column. This is similar to the ORM
concepts. Besides, a model has a list of auto 
[handlers](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler) which is equivalent to HTTP 
endpoints in traditional HTTP frameworks. Developers can declare custom request 
handlers under the model.

## Declare a model

A model is declared in Teo schema like this:

```teo showLineNumbers
/// @name Platform User
///
/// Users on our platform.
model User {
  @id
  id: Int
  @unique
  email: String
  name: String
  @default(18)
  age: Int
}
```

## Model content

A model has a name, optionally a documented readable name, optionally a 
documented description, a list of fields, optionally a list of custom 
[handlers](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler), optionally a list of 
model level [decorators](/concepts/components/teo-schema/decorator), a primary
index, and optionally a list of [indexes](/concepts/components/teo-schema/index) 
and unique indexes.

## Fields

Model fields fall into 3 main categories:

  * [Model scalar field](/concepts/components/teo-schema/model-field)
  * [Model relation](/concepts/components/teo-schema/model-relation)
  * [Model property](/concepts/components/teo-schema/model-property)

## Primary index

A model must have one primary index. It can be a on single scalar field, or a 
compound index of some scalar fields.

### A single field primary index

An `@id` decorator can be placed on a scalar number or string field.

```teo
model User {
  @id
  id: Int
  @unique
  email: String
}
```

### A compound primary index

Place the `@id` decorator on the model level to create a compound primary 
index.

```teo
@id([.id, .email])
model User {
  id: Int
  email: String
}
```

## Handlers

Handlers are custom HTTP API endpoints. Except auto handlers synthesized by Teo
for models to perform basic CRUD and aggregation, developers must provide the
implementation with the server API.

### Auto-synthesized handlers

Teo synthesizes common CRUD and aggregate handlers for models. See 
[Builtin auto-synthesized handlers](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler#builtin-auto-synthesized-handlers) 
for a list of auto-synthesized handlers.

### Custom handlers

A custom handler can be placed within the model block.

```teo
model User {
  @id
  id: Int
  name: String

  declare handler myCustomCreate(input: MyCustomInput): MyCustomOutput
}
```

See [handler](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler)
