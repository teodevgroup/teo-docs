# Interface

Interface is similar to TypeScript's interface. Internally it's a `Dictionary` 
schema type with each field being typed. Interface supports type generics and
it's useful for custom [handlers](/concepts/components/teo-schema/handler)
<span className="concept">CONCEPT</span>, generated model entities and 
generated query clients.

The interface declaration feels like TypeScript, too:

```teo showLineNumbers
interface DataMeta<T, U> {
  data: T
  meta: U
}
```

## Multiple inheritance

Interface can be extended.

```teo showLineNumbers
interface Triple<T> {
    single: T
    double: (T, T) 
}

interface Description {
    description: String
}

interface TripleInt extends Triple<Int>, Description {
    sum: Int
}
```

In the code snippet above, the `TripleInt` interface contains 4 fields while 3
of them are inherited.
