# Guard

Guards are role based access control. Instead of defining roles, we
describe it in places we need it. This is more flexible, readable and
descriptive.

Permissions include:
- `canMutate` whether this person can create, update or delete
- `canRead` whether this person can read

## Model guard

A model guard protects API on the model level.

```teo showLineNumbers
@canRead($identity($is($self)))
@canMutate(
  $when(.update, $identity($is($self)))
  .when(.delete, $identity($is($self)))
)
@identity
model Rider {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @unique @identity
  email: String
  @writeonly @identityChecker($bcryptVerify($self.get(.password)))
  @onSet($hasLength(8...16).isSecurePassword.bcryptSalt)
  password: String
  @relation(fields: .id, references: .riderId)
  orders: Order[]
}

@canRead($identity($is($self, .rider)))
@canMutate(
  $when(.update, $identity($is($self, .rider)))
  .when(.delete, $identity($is($self, .rider)))
  .when(.create, $identity($isA(Rider)))
)
model Order {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @foreignKey
  riderId: Int
  @relation(fields: .riderId, references: .id)
  rider: Rider
}
```

In this example, only rider can delete or update him/herself. Only order owner
can update or delete his/her orders.

## Field guard

A field guard protects API on the field level.

A field has permissions, too. Field value is removed from the output if a user
has model read permission but doesn't have field read permission. `delete`
action is not triggered on fields.

```teo showLineNumbers
model Order {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @canMutate($identity($is($self, .rider)))
  amount: Int
  @foreignKey
  riderId: Int
  @relation(fields: .riderId, references: .id)
  rider: Rider
}
```

In this example, only order's owner can change the amount.
