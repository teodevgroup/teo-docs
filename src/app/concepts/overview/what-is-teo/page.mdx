# What is Teo?

This article gives a high-level overview of what Teo is and how it works.

If you want to get started with a practical introduction and learn about
writing Teo server and generate clients, head over to the
**[Getting started](/getting-started)** documentation.

To learn more about the motivation for Teo, check out the
**[Why Teo?](/concepts/overview/why-teo)** page.

## What is Teo?

Teo is a schema-centered web server framework. It consists of the following 
parts:

- **Teo schema**: Intuitive and innovative schema language which is descriptive
and readable
- **Teo server**: A high performance core written in Rust and API bindings for
Node.js, Python and Rust
- **Teo CLI**: A CLI tool that reads schema and perform jobs including database 
migration, running server and seeding data
- **Teo query client**: Auto-generated type-safe query builder for multiple
platforms and languages

## How does Teo work?

Like any other web server frameworks, developers write code, start server and
deploy. What is unique to Teo is most of the coding can be done with the
intuitive schema language. For features Teo schema language doesn't provide,
Teo allows developers to generate ORM model entities, write custom code and 
route handlers in backend languages.

### Teo schema

Developers declare configurations, enums and models all within these schema
files. These files can be splitted and included. Here is an example of a
minimalist Teo schema.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
connector {
  provider: .mysql,
  url: "mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/hello"
}

server {
  bind: ("0.0.0.0", 5001)
}

client ts {
  provider: .typeScript,
  dest: "../hello-client/"
  package: true,
  host: .string("http://127.0.0.1:5001"),
  gitCommit: true
}

model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @unique @onSet($if($presents, $isEmail))
  email: String
  name: String?
}
```

With this schema, Teo synthesizes HTTP request handlers for the model entity
`User`. When server is running, the frontend apps can send request to create,
update, delete and read users.

### Teo server

Developers can declare custom route handlers in the schema and implement it
with server code. Ruby, Node.js and Python are supported.

```teo showLineNumbers title="schema.teo"
interface EmptyInput { }

interface HelloOutput {
  hello: String
}

declare handler hello(EmptyInput): HelloOutput
```

Depending on the server side programming language that you choose, the 
implementation to the handler declared above is implemented in below.

<RustDoc>
```rust showLineNumbers title="src/main.rs"
app.main_namespace().define_handler("hello", || async move {
  Ok::<Response, Error>(Response::data(teon!({ "hello": "world!" })))
});
```
</RustDoc>
<NodeJSDoc>
```ts showLineNumbers title="app.ts"
app.mainNamespace().defineHandler("hello", async () => {
  return Response.data({ "hello": "world!" })
})
```
</NodeJSDoc>
<PythonDoc>
```python showLineNumbers title="app.py"
async def hello(_ctx):
  return Response.data({ "hello": "world!" })

app.main_namespace().define_handler("hello", hello)
```
</PythonDoc>

### Teo query client

Teo cares about developer experience. Instead of copy and paste data access
objects into different frontend projects, Teo generate for us. For example, to
access the aforementioned `User` model, with TypeScript client, we can do:

```ts showLineNumbers
const createResult = await teo.user.create({
  create: {
    email: "ada2@teodev.io",
    name: "Ada",
  }
})
console.log(createResult.data)
```

Teo query client is type-safe and smart.

## Typical Teo workflows

Teo simplifies the backend server development. Normally developers
update schemas and generate query clients. If custom code is required, generate 
model entities and write custom logic with one of the backend programming 
languages that Teo supports. On server start, database migration is 
automatically performed. You can also trigger migration by its own command. 
Teo web server is performant, and reliable.
