# Selecting fields

By default, a query returns all readable scalar fields. Selecting only the
fields that you require rather than relying on the default selection set can
reduce the size of the response and improve query speed.

The selection can be nested inside related relations, too. The following query
returns only artist name and song name.

<CodeResult name="HTTP response" defaultOpen={true}>
```typescript showLineNumbers
const { data: artists } = await teo.artist.findMany({
  select: {
    name: true
  },
  include: {
    songs: {
      select: {
        name: true
      }
    },
  }
})
```
```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "name": "Angela Peterson",
    "songs": [
      {
        "name": "Forever in Safe"
      },
      {
        "name": "Fairy Tale"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Tony Justin",
    "songs": []
  }
]
```
</CodeResult>
