# Relation queries

By default, none related records are fetched for a query. With `include`,
related records can be fetched into the result set together. The nested
argument inside `include`, behaves like `findMany`'s argument or `findUnique`'s
argument depending on whether the relation is single or many.

```typescript showLineNumbers
const { data: artists } = await teo.artist.findMany({
  include: {
    songs: {
      where: {
        name: { startsWith: 'Fairy' }
      }
    },
  }
})
```
```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Angela Peterson",
    "age": 23,
    "songs": [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Fairy Tale",
        "published": true
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Tony Justin",
    "age": 27,
    "songs": []
  }
]
```
</CodeResult>
